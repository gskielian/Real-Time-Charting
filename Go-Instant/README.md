Go-Instant
==========


This service is very much like Firebase but uses Go on the backend (well I'm not really sure what Firebase uses on its backend so I shouldn't draw this distinction).

Also like Firebase, there is no need to have your own server to implement this -- just link their javascript library to your html file and your golden.


Free-Tier
---------

The free-tier of Go-Instant is pretty cool, you get unlimited data-transfer and peak-connections (at least while it is in beta).

Even after beta, Go-Instant will permit users 1 entirely free app -- which is great for me since I usually just need one app per student.
